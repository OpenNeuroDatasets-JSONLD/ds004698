# Center for Human Neuroscience (CHN) Retinotopic Mapping Dataset

The Center for Human Neuroscience (CHN) Retinotopic Mapping Dataset collected at the University of Washington is part of "Improving the reliability and accuracy of population receptive field measures using a 'log-bar' stimulus." by Kelly Chang, Ione Fine, and Geoffrey M. Boynton.

The full dataset is comprised of the raw, preprocessed (with fMRIPrep), and pRF estimated data from 12 participants across 2 sessions.

## Dataset Organization

- `dataset`  
   This directory contains the raw, unprocessed data for each participant. 

- `dataset/derivatives/fmriprep`  
   This directory contains the fMRIPrep processed data for each particpant. 

- `dataset/derivatives/freesurfer`  
   This directory contains the standard FreeSurfer processed data for each participant. 

- `dataset/derivatives/prf-estimation`  
   This directory contains the pRF estimation data and results for each participant.

- `dataset/derivatives/prf-estimation/files`  
   This directory contains miscellaneous files used for pRF estimation or visualizations.

   - `angle_lut.json`: Custom polar angle lookup table for visualization with FreeSurfer's `freeview`.
   - `eccen_lut.json`: Custom eccentricity lookup table for visualization with FreeSurfer's `freeview`.
   - `participants_hrf_paramters.json`: Corresponding metadata for `participants_hrf_paramters.tsv`.
   - `participants_hrf_paramters.tsv`: Estimated HRF parameters used during pRF estimation by participant and hemisphere. 

- `dataset/derivatives/prf-estimation/stimuli`  
   This directory contains the stimuli used in the experiment and stimulus apertures used in pRF estimation.

   - `task-(fixed|log)bar_run-<n>`: Name of the stimulus condition and run number.
   - `*_desc-full_stim.mat`: Stimulus images (uint8) at `full` resolution of 540 by 540 pixels and 6 Hz.
   - `*_desc-down_aperture.mat`: Stimulus aperature (binary) where 1s indicated stimulus and 0s indicated the background at a downsampled (`down`) resolution of 108 by 108 pixels and 1 Hz.
